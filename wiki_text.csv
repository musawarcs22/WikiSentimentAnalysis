"Following the creation of Pakistan, she migrated to Lahore with the rest of Khan's maternal relatives."
"Khan's maternal family has produced a number of cricketers, including those who have represented Pakistan, such as his cousins Javed Burki and Majid Khan."
"Maternally, Khan is also a descendant of the Sufi warrior-poet and inventor of the Pashto alphabet, Pir Roshan, who hailed from his maternal family's ancestral Kaniguram town located in South Waziristan in the tribal areas of northwest Pakistan."
"His maternal family was based in Basti Danishmanda, Jalandhar, India for about 600 years."

"In 1972, he enrolled in Keble College, Oxford where he studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics, graduating in 1975."
"An enthusiast for college cricket at Keble, Paul Hayes, was instrumental in securing the admission of Khan, after he had been turned down by Cambridge."
Khan made his first-class cricket debut at the age of 16 in Lahore.
"By the start of the 1970s, he was playing for his home teams of Lahore A (1969–70), Lahore B (1969–70), Lahore Greens (1970–71) and, eventually, Lahore (1970–71)."

"After graduating from Oxford and finishing his tenure at Worcestershire, he returned to Pakistan in 1976 and secured a permanent place on his native national team starting from the 1976–1977 season, during which they faced New Zealand and Australia."
"Following the Australian series, he toured the West Indies, where he met Tony Greig, who signed him up for Kerry Packer's World Series Cricket."
"His credentials as one of the fastest bowlers in the world started to become established when he finished third at 139.7 km/h in a fast bowling contest at Perth in 1978, behind Jeff Thomson and Michael Holding, but ahead of Dennis Lillee, Garth Le Roux and Andy Roberts."
"During the late 1970s, Khan was one of the pioneers of the reverse swing bowling technique."
"He imparted this trick to the bowling duo of Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis, who mastered and popularised this art in later years."
"As a bowler, Khan initially bowled with a relatively chest-on action, at medium-pace."
"However he worked hard to remodel his action to a more classical type, and to strengthen his body, to enable fast bowling."
Khan attained his prime as a fast bowler in January 1980 till 1988 when he became out and out fast bowler.
During this span Imran picked 236 test wickets at 17.77 apiece with 18 five-wicket hauls and 5 10 wicket hauls.
"His bowling average and strike rate were better than Richard Hadlee (19.03), Malcolm Marshall (20.20), Dennis Lillee (24.07), Joel Garner (20.62) and Michael Holding (23.68)."
"In January 1983, playing against India, he attained a Test bowling rating of 922 points."

"He ended his career with 88 Test matches, 126 innings and scored 3807 runs at an average of 37.69, including six centuries and 18 fifties."
His highest score was 136.
"As a bowler, he took 362 wickets in Test cricket, which made him the first Pakistani and world's fourth bowler to do so."
"In ODIs, he played 175 matches and scored 3709 runs at an average of 33.41."
His highest score was 102 not out.
"His best ODI bowling was 6 wickets for 14 runs, a record for the best bowling figures by any bowler in an ODI innings in a losing cause."
"At the height of his career, in 1982, the thirty-year-old Khan took over the captaincy of the Pakistan cricket team from Javed Miandad."
"As a captain, Khan played 48 Test matches, of which 14 were won by Pakistan, 8 lost and the remaining 26 were drawn."
"He also played 139 ODIs, winning 77, losing 57 and ending one in a tie."
"In the team's second match, Khan led them to their first Test win on English soil for 28 years at Lord's."
Khan's first year as captain was the peak of his legacy as a fast bowler as well as an all-rounder.
He recorded the best Test bowling of his career while taking 8 wickets for 58 runs against Sri Lanka at Lahore in 1981–1982.
"He also topped both the bowling and batting averages against England in three-Test series in 1982, taking 21 wickets and averaging 56 with the bat."
"Later the same year, he put up a highly acknowledged performance in a home series against the formidable Indian team by taking 40 wickets in six Tests at an average of 13.95."
"By the end of this series in 1982–1983, Khan had taken 88 wickets in 13 Test matches over a period of one year as captain."
"This same Test series against India, however, also resulted in a stress fracture in his shin that kept him out of cricket for more than two years."
An experimental treatment funded by the Pakistani government helped him recover by the end of 1984 and he made a successful comeback to international cricket in the latter part of the 1984–1985 season.
"In 1987 in India, Khan led Pakistan in its first-ever Test series win and this was followed by Pakistan's first series victory in England during the same year."
"During the 1980s, his team also recorded three creditable draws against the West Indies."
"India and Pakistan co-hosted the 1987 Cricket World Cup, but neither ventured beyond the semi-finals."
Khan retired from international cricket at the end of the World Cup.
"In 1988, he was asked to return to the captaincy by the President of Pakistan, General Zia-Ul-Haq, and on 18 January, he announced his decision to rejoin the team."
"Soon after returning to the captaincy, Khan led Pakistan to another winning tour in the West Indies, which he has recounted as ""the last time I really bowled well""."
He was declared Man of the Series against West Indies in 1988 when he took 23 wickets in 3 Tests.
Khan's career-high as a captain and cricketer came when he led Pakistan to victory in the 1992 Cricket World Cup.
"Playing with a brittle batting line-up, Khan promoted himself as a batsman to play in the top order along with Javed Miandad, but his contribution as a bowler was minimal."
"At the age of 39, Khan took the winning last wicket himself."
"After retiring, Khan remarked that there was ball tampering during his early cricketing days when playing domestic cricket."
"Khan had said that, during  matches, he ""occasionally scratched the side of the ball and lifted the seam."""
"However, Khan defended his actions in the same interview, arguing his conduct was commonplace at the time, even that spin bowlers would lift the seam (i.e. mildly ball tamper), further Khan argued that as he did not lift the seam of the ball above the normal level he was not violating the rules and spirit of the game within the rules defined whilst he was a player."
"Further, Khan argued that umpires in his 21 years of cricket had not complained about his conduct, Khan remarked that ""The sole judge of fair and unfair play on the cricket field is the umpire""."
"He had also added, ""Only once did I use an object."
When Sussex was playing Hampshire in 1981 the ball was not deviating at all.
"I got the 12th man to bring out a bottle top and it started to move around a lot."""
"In 1996, Khan successfully defended himself in a libel action brought forth by former English captain and all-rounder Ian Botham and batsman Allan Lamb over comments they alleged were made by Khan in two articles about the above-mentioned ball-tampering and another article published in an Indian magazine, India Today."
"They claimed that, in the latter publication, Khan had called the two cricketers ""racist, ill-educated and lacking in class."""
" Khan protested that he had been misquoted, saying that he was defending himself after having admitted that he tampered with a ball in a county match 18 years ago."
"Khan won the libel case, which the judge labelled a ""complete exercise in futility"", with a 10–2 majority decision by the jury."

"On 26 February 2014, University of Bradford Union floated a motion to remove Khan from the post over Khan's absence from every graduation ceremony since 2010."

"However, he repeatedly criticised the war crimes trials in Bangladesh in favour of the convicts."
"His sympathetic position toward the Pakistani Taliban and Afghan Taliban, as well as his criticism of the US-led war on terror, has earned him the moniker ""Taliban Khan"" in Pakistani politics."

He is against US drone strikes and plans to disengage Pakistan from the US-led war on terror.
"Khan also opposes almost all military operations, including the Siege of Lal Masjid."
"In 2010, Khan said in an interview: ""I grew up hating India because I grew up in Lahore and there were massacres of 1947, so much bloodshed and anger."
"But as I started touring India, I got such love and friendship there that all this disappeared."
"""In August 2012, the Pakistani Taliban issued death threats if he went ahead with his march to their tribal stronghold along the Afghan border to protest US drone attacks, because he calls himself a ""liberal"" – a term they associate with a lack of religious belief."
"On 1 October 2012, prior to his plan to address a rally in South Waziristan, senior commanders of Pakistani Taliban said after a meeting headed by the Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud that they now offered Khan security assistance for the rally because of Khan's opposition to drone attacks in Pakistan, reversing their previous stance."

On 7 May, just four days before the elections, Khan was rushed to Shaukat Khanum hospital in Lahore after he tumbled from a forklift at the edge of a stage and fell headfirst to the ground."

Khan entered into an agreement with the Sharif administration to establish a three-member high-powered judicial commission which would be formed under a presidential ordinance.
The commission would make its final report public.
"If the commission finds a country-wide pattern of rigging proved, the prime minister would dissolve the national and provincial assemblies in terms of the articles 58(1) and 112(1) of the Constitution – thereby meaning that the premier would also appoint the caretaker setup in consultation with the leader of the opposition and fresh elections would be held."

"Nawaz Sharif and his PML-N party, in particular, claimed that a conspiracy between the judiciary and military had influenced the election in favour of Khan and PTI."
"The Election Commission, however, rejected allegations of rigging and Sharif and his PML-N later conceded victory to Khan, despite lingering 'reservations' regarding the result."

"After the election, Khan made some appointments and nominations for national and provincial level public office holders as the head of the winning party."
Asad Umar was designated finance minister in the future government of Khan in the center.
"Khan nominated Imran Ismail for Governor of Sindh, Mahmood Khan as future Chief Minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Chaudhry Muhammad Sarwar as Governor of Punjab, Asad Qaiser as Speaker of the National Assembly of Pakistan, and Shah Farman as Governor of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa."
"In Balochistan, his party decided to support Balochistan Awami Party which nominated Jam Kamal Khan for chief minister and former chief minister Abdul Quddus Bizenjo for speaker."
"His party nominated Pakistan Muslim League (Q) leader and former Deputy Prime Minister of Pakistan, Pervaiz Elahi for the slot of Speaker of the Punjab Assembly."
Abdul Razak Dawood was nominated to be the advisor to prime minister on economic affairs.
Qasim Khan Suri was nominated for deputy speaker of national assembly slot.
Mushtaq Ahmed Ghani and Mehmood Jan were nominated as speaker and deputy speaker of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa assembly respectively.
Dost Muhammad Mazari was nominated as Deputy Speaker for the Provincial Assembly of Punjab.
Khan nominated Sardar Usman Buzdar for Chief Minister of Punjab.
"Announcing the nomination, Khan said that he chose Buzdar because he belongs to the most backward area of Punjab."
"According to some sources, Buzdar was nominated as a makeshift arrangement because it will be easier to remove a lesser-known individual when Shah Mahmood Qureshi is ready to become chief minister."
"On 17 August 2018, Khan secured 176 votes and became 22nd Prime Minister of Pakistan and took oath of office on 18 August 2018."
"Khan ordered top level reshuffling in the country's bureaucracy, including the appointment of Sohail Mahmood as Foreign Secretary, Rizwan Ahmed as Maritime Secretary and Naveed Kamran Baloch as Finance Secretary."
His first major appointment in the Pakistan Army was that of Lieutenant General Asim Munir to the key slot of Director-General of Inter-Services Intelligence.
"Khan announced his cabinet soon after taking oath, choosing to keep the Ministry of Interior to himself."
Though he later appointed Ijaz Ahmed Shah as interior minister.
"Many of his appointees were previously ministers during Musharraf era, although some were defectors from the left-wing People's Party."
"In 2019 Khan committed to a major cabinet reshuffle in the ministries of interior, finance, information and planning."
"Khan stated that despite the assassination of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Pakistan must prioritize good relations with Saudi Arabia due to an economic crisis."
"He also added that U.S. sanctions against Iran are affecting neighboring Pakistan, stating ""The last thing the Muslim World needs is another conflict."
"The Trump administration is moving towards that direction."""
"Khan has prioritised close ties with China, saying he ""did not know"" much about concentration camps for China's Muslims."
"Though Khan confirmed he had raised the matter ""privately"" in discussions with China."
"Khan was named one of Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People of 2019.In domestic economic policy, Khan inherited a twin balance of payments and debt crisis with a large current account deficit and fiscal deficit in 2018, Khan's government sought a bailout from the IMF."
"In exchange for the bailout, Khan's government slashed subsidy spending in the energy sector and unveiled an austerity budget to curb the fiscal deficit and limit government borrowing."
"Also, the IMF demanded that the Pakistani government depreciate the rupee, and improve tax collection."
"Khan's government decided to raise import tariffs to collect higher tax revenues and devalued the currency, this alongside the heavy import duty helped to curtail the current account deficit (see import substitution)."
"Pakistan's overall balance of payment's position improved significantly following record-high remittances in 2020, which stabilised the central bank's foreign exchange reserves."
The fiscal deficit narrowed to less than 1% of GDP by 2020 due to the government's austerity policies.
"Thus the rate of debt accumulation had significantly slowed, but Pakistan's debt remained high due to the high borrowing of previous governments in which the current government had to allocate $24 billion to pay off loans taken during the tenure of previous governments."
"Aside from IMF-mandated reforms, Khan's government introduced policies to improve the business operating climate."
"As a result, Pakistan climbed 28 places higher on the World Bank's ease of doing business index."
Pakistan ranked amongst the top 10 most improved countries in 2019.
Pakistan's tax collection also hit record highs in 2019.
As the government raised more revenue from domestic taxes with no increase in tax revenue from import taxes (given import compression had lowered the quantity being imported so the government collected less tax revenue from imports).
"This trend continued into 2020, albeit at a slower pace."
"The fiscal deficit was also controlled to less than 1% of GDP in the second half of 2020, Pakistan recorded a primary surplus (excluding interest payment and principal repayment of previous debt), but was in deficit once the interest payment on debt was accounted for, albeit the deficit was smaller."
Economists primarily pinned this reduction in the fiscal deficit on an increase in non-tax revenues rather than an increase in tax revenues.
"For example, from the higher prices"
", consumers paid for oil from state-owned oil companies."
"Nevertheless, tax revenues also went on an upward trajectory with Pakistan's tax agency (FBR) both exceeding its tax collection target and collecting a record amount for the first quarter of the fiscal year 2021 in the calendar year 2020.In economic policy with respect to international trade, from January 2020 Khan's government implemented the second phase of the China–Pakistan Free Trade Agreement these renegotiations with China led to concessionary rates by China on Pakistani exports of goods and services to mainland China such as reduced tariffs or zero tariffs."
"The negotiations were termed a ""significant milestone"" in the country's foreign policy by expanding trade relations in a relationship traditionally dominated by defence and security matters."
"In June 2018 (before Khan's election as Prime Minister), the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) placed Pakistan on a grey list and demanded a series of actions be taken by Pakistan to remedy terror financing laws."
Khan's government had initially used constitutional provisions of Presidential power held by Arif Alvi to issue ordinances (temporary legislation via Presidential decree) and the country became compliant with 14 points on the FATF agenda.
"Subsequently, a series of bills were presented in Pakistan's parliament to ensure the legislation would permanently remain in place beyond a temporary Presidential decree."
Minor parts of the legislation passed both the lower house and upper house of Pakistan's parliament with the support of Khan's ruling coalition and part of the opposition parties too.
"However, the opposition-dominated Senate did not pass a significant portion of the FATF bills."
"Subsequently, Khan summoned a joint session of both upper and lower house of parliament in which the bills passed given the government held a majority and without the support of the opposition."
"By October 2020, Pakistan became successfully compliant on 21 out of 27 points on the FATF agenda, an increase from the 14 points in February 2020, with the remaining 6 points outstanding reviewed in February 2021."
"In FATF's February 2021 review, Khan's government had successfully implemented about 90% of the FATF agenda with 24 out of 27 points 'largely addressed' and the remaining 3 out of 27 points 'partially addressed'."
"The FATF President remarked that as Pakistan was progressing with its action plan so it ""is not the time to put a country on the blacklist""."
"In FATF’s June 2021 review, the Khan government implemented more progress, the FATF found that Pakistan has now largely addressed 26 out of the 27 action items, US State Department spokesperson Ned Price praised Pakistan’s progress but encouraged Pakistan to tackle its remaining action item saying ""We do recognise and we support Pakistan's continued efforts to satisfy those (first action plan) obligations."
"Pakistan has made significant progress on its first action plan with 26 of 27 action items largely addressed — We encourage Pakistan to continue working with the FATF and the international community to swiftly complete the remaining action item by demonstrating that terrorism financing, investigations and prosecutions target senior leaders and commanders of UN-designated groups,"" he said."
"On 8 April 2022 the Khan government made progress on its remaining action plan by sentencing Hafiz Saeed a mastermind of the 26/11 Mumbai attacks and a UN-designated terrorist to 31 years in prisonIn national security policy, Khan's government presided over an improved overall security climate with foreign investors expressing greater confidence in the security of their investments in Pakistan."
"On 5 March 2019 the Khan government formally banned the Hafiz Saeed-led Jamaat-ud-Dawa and its affiliate Falah-e-Insaniat Foundation under the Anti Terrorism Act 1997.On 25 June 2020, Khan came under criticism, both in the international press and from the domestic opposition, for calling al-Qaeda founder and 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden a martyr."
"Khan, on a previous occasion during a local television interview, had refused to call bin Laden a terrorist."
"In October 2020, Imran Khan spoke out about the growing extremism and violence against Muslims, across the world."
"In a letter posted on Twitter, he urged Facebook’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg to ban Islamophobic content on its platform."
"In July 2021, the Project Pegasus revealed a spyware surveillance list that included at least one number once used by Khan."
"In 2019 Pakistan arrested Hafiz Saeed a mastermind of the 26/11 Mumbai attacks also a UN-designated terrorist, and on 8 April 2022 he was sentenced to 31 years in prison."
"In social policy, Khan's government has taken steps to restore religious sites belonging to religious minorities  this included the Kartarpur Corridor."
"Khan's government took a significantly different position on the policy of minorities than the main opposition party, the PML-N, who had opposed the building of the corridor for Indian pilgrims."
Khan's government also instituted reforms to education and healthcare on a national and regional level respectively.
Khan's government introduced reforms to Pakistan's social safety net and the system of welfare in Pakistan more broadly.
"This included broadening welfare payments which was initially for widows only, to include the disabled as well as provide health insurance coverage."
"In June 2021, Khan explained a surge of publicly known rape cases in Pakistan with what he called ""common sense"", namely that women who wear ""very few clothes"" will ""have an impact on the men unless they are robots""."
His comments lead to outrage by female rights activists.
Khan pushed for an increase in renewable energy production and halted coal power from future construction working toward an aim to make Pakistan mostly renewable by 2030.
"In 2020, Khan's government commenced building work for the Diamer-Bhasha Dam, as part of his government's investment in renewable energy projects."
The World Bank loaned Pakistan $450mn for investment in renewable energy projects as part of the government's stated aim of making Pakistan a renewable-energy reliant economy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change.
"The government also introduced of an electric vehicle (EV) policy, the first in South Asia."
"Further efforts to combat climate change consisted of re-foresting Pakistan with over 10 billion trees under the Plant for Pakistan project with the government on course to plant 3.3 billion trees in the first three and a half years of Khan's government, the reforestation programme includes an agreement with the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and others to independently monitor the projects in order to maintain transparency about funding."
Khan also expanded national parks under a protected areas initiative.
Khan's government introduced reforms to Pakistan's bloated public sector.
"The public sector consisted of state-owned enterprises that were consistently making losses and accumulating debt for decades, including national services such as railways, airlines, postal services as well as other state-owned companies such as Pakistan's state-owned steel company."
"In 2019, Pakistan International Airlines reached breakeven in operating profit however the halt in air travel in the following year due to COVID-19 meant further reforms had to be made."
This led to a proposal to cut the airline's workforce almost by half in order to save costs and thus help the state-owned airline breakeven on a net profit level in addition to the operating profit level.
The national airline confirmed it would layoff employees in phases as part of PIA's restructuring plan in line with the government's policy of reversing the losses at state-owned companies.
Khan's government is set to axe many PIA workers due to the fact that those appointments were politically motivated to reward loyalty to previous governments.
"In 2019, Khan's government launched an anti-corruption campaign which was premised on the basis that no amnesty (known as NRO or National Reconciliation Ordinance in Pakistani political parlance) would be given to politicians or relatives who benefitted from a politician's patronage."
The campaign has been criticised for targeting Khan's political opponents.
"Nevertheless, Khan's supporters argue that the campaign is genuine, as senior members of Khan's own ruling party, including Jahangir Khan Tareen and Aleem Khan, have faced investigation or prosecution, with Khan going as far as rejecting the formation of a ""judicial commission"" demanded by supporters of Tareen."
"Under Khan's premiership, the performance of Pakistan's anti-corruption agency, the National Accountability Bureau improved significantly when measured in terms of recovery of money in cases involving plea bargains and/or convictions."
The recovery of the anti-corruption agency had risen to Rs. 487 billion over three years from the start of 2018 to the beginning of 2021.
This recovery was significantly higher than the anti-corruption agency's 10-year performance from 2008 to 2018 prior to Khan's government taking office.
"During the COVID-19 pandemic, Khan's government rolled out the largest welfare programme in Pakistan's history, with a fund of almost $1 billion aimed at the country's poorest segment of the population."
"The PM's advisor Dr. Sania Nishtar confirmed that the programme would use pre-existing data of other welfare programmes under 'Ehsaas' system and the much smaller Benazir Income Support Programme which provided a more limited safety-net, while the Ehsaas programme targeted lower-income households more broadly."
"Following a drop in COVID-19 cases, declining positivity rates, and falling hospitalisations, Khan's government lifted lockdown restrictions."
"In a Gallup survey released in 2021, 7 out of 10 (or roughly 70%) of Pakistanis had a favourable view of the government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic."
"Economically, a V-shaped recovery was observed in both business confidence and expected employment index."
The current account was in surplus for 3 out of 4 months after June 2020 although this was due to higher remittances (which tend to be volatile) offsetting decrease in exports.
"Fiscal prudence meant Pakistan's debt-to-GDP ratio remained broadly unchanged in 2021 according to the IMF, Pakistan defied the trend of rising debt, as most emerging/developing economies had witnessed a substantial rise in the debt-to-GDP ratio in order to deal with the pandemic with other developing countries seeing a 10% rise in debt-to-GDP on average."
"Furthermore, credit rating agency Fitch forecasted a fall in Pakistan's public debt to GDP ratio, reflecting lower debt incurred by the incumbent government and higher GDP growth in 2021.In economic policy, Khan's government presided over a recovery in Pakistan's textile sector, with demand measured by the number of orders pending hitting historic highs."
Khan's government facilitated the textile sector by offering concessionary rates on utilities such as electricity as well as reducing the electricity tariff during peak hours.
"Furthermore, the Asian Development Bank stated that it sees an ""economic recovery"" in Pakistan."
"Also, signs of recovery emerged as exports reached pre-covid levels towards the end of 2020."
"Following the recovery in the textile sector, export growth was almost in double-digits by February 2021, with a 9% growth in exports – especially value-added textile exports."
"In early 2021, Pakistan's apparel exports to the US had surged upwards in value and volume outperforming India and Bangladesh, both of which are the nearest regional economies similar to Pakistan's in South Asia."
"Khan's government facilitated the textile sector by removing all import tariffs on cotton yarn, in order to address a shortfall in the main raw material input of textiles and apparel."
This policy of tax concessions was codified at least in the short term when Khan's government unveiled its budget for 2021–22 which had reduced customs duty on imports of inputs (raw materials) for final manufactured goods.
"In foreign policy, Khan voiced support for the 2019 Turkish offensive into north-eastern Syria against the Kurdish-led SDF."
"On 11 October 2019, Khan told the Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan that ""Pakistan fully understands Turkey's concerns relating to terrorism""."
Khan's foreign policy towards neighbouring Afghanistan consists primarily of support for the Afghan peace process and also inaugurated a 24/7 border crossing with Afghanistan to facilitate travel and trade.
"He said that Pakistan will never recognize Israel until a Palestinian state is created, a statement in line with the vision of Pakistan's founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah."
"According to the British newspaper The Independent, Khan's government had improved Pakistan's reputation abroad by stepping into its role as a 'world player'."
"In 2019, Khan was included in the Time 100, Time's annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world."
"Khan also pursued a reset in ties with Gulf Arab states such as the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, with the UAE agreeing to roll over Pakistan's debt on an interest-free loan."
"Subsequently, Khan embarked on a three-day visit to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in order to reset ties, where he was personally received at the airport by Mohammad bin Salman."
The ties had become tense previously due to the unwillingness of Pakistan to contribute militarily to the Saudi Arabian–led intervention in Yemen.
"Saudi Arabia's ambassador to Pakistan confirmed that the Saudi government had approved a concessionary loan for building a hydroelectric dam, the Mohmand dam."
"Khan's government also improved ties with the Gulf state of Kuwait, as Kuwait confirmed it had lifted a ten-year visa ban on Pakistani nationals."
Khan's government enhanced economic ties with Qatar which is expected to benefit Pakistan by US$3 billion over 10 years by renegotiating terms in an energy supply deal which saw a significant reduction in Pakistan's energy import bill compared to the previous deal.
"Khan was mediating between Iran and Saudi Arabia in an effort to end the war in Yemen, which is part of an Iran–Saudi Arabia proxy conflict."
"On 9 May 2021, Khan condemned the Israeli police actions at Al-Aqsa Mosque, stating that such actions violated ""all norms of humanity and  law""."
"Also, Khan has been vocal on the Kashmir issue, and his government adopted the foreign policy stance that no talks will be held with India on the Kashmir dispute until autonomy was restored in Indian-held Kashmir."
Khan's national security adviser Moeed Yusuf confirmed that backdoor contacts with India (ostensibly brokered by the UAE) had broken down after India had refused to restore the region's autonomy.
"In August 2021, Khan celebrated the departure of the United States from Afghanistan, describing it as Afghans breaking ""the shackles of slavery""."
"Khan met with Russian president Vladimir Putin in February 2022, shortly after Putin had directed an invasion of Ukraine."
"On 8 March 2022, opposition parties submitted a motion of no confidence against him to the National Assembly's secretariat."
"On 1 April 2022, Prime Minister Khan announced that in context of the no-confidence motion against him in the National Assembly, the three options were discussed with ""establishment"" to choose from viz: ""resignation, no-confidence  or elections""."
"On 3 April 2022, while addressing the Nation Imran Khan announced that he had advised the President of Pakistan to dissolve the National Assembly of Pakistan."
On dissolution of the National Assembly of Pakistan a circular issued by the government declared that Imran Khan had ceased to hold the office of Prime Minister of Pakistan.
"This culminated in a constitutional crisis, as according to article 224 (A) of the Pakistani constitution, an incumbent prime minister continues to hold the office of Prime Minister on an interim basis until a caretaker prime minister is appointed."
"On 10 April, a no-confidence vote was conducted and he was ousted from office, becoming the first prime minister in Pakistan to be removed from office by a vote of no confidence."
Khan claimed the US was behind his removal because he conducted an independent foreign policy and had friendly relations with China and Russia.
His removal led to protests from his supporters across Pakistan.
"In 2019, Election Commission of Pakistan released details of financial statements of members of the National Assembly for the year 2018–2019."
"Prime Minister Imran Khan owned assets worth ₨108.236 million (US$680,000) minus his Bani Gala residence."
"He has a house in Zaman Park, Lahore worth ₨29 million (US$180,000)."
"Khan is also an investor, investing more than ₨40 million (US$250,000) in various businesses."
"He is also owner of agriculture land of 39 kanals at Talhar, Islamabad, and 530 kanals at Khanewal."
"Further, he also has a share in 363 kanals of agricultural land which he inherited."
"Khan has paid ₨10.19 million (US$64,000) to buy two apartments at Shahra-e-Dastoor in Islamabad  Other assets include furniture of ₨0.6 million (US$3,700) and livestock of ₨0.2 million (US$1,200)."
However he has no vehicle registered in his name.
"Khan owns a 300 kanal mansion in Bani Gala, Islamabad worth ₨750 million (US$4.7 million)."
Khan declared it as a gift in his statement to the Election Commission of Pakistan.
The mansion is located within a gated enclosure and is accessible through a private driveway.
It is the permanent residence of Imran Khan.
"In November 2019, using FBR statements, Pakistani media revealed how much tax Khan had paid in 37 years."
"Khan paid ₨103,763 (US$650) of tax in 2017, and over 37 years, he paid a total of ₨4 million (equivalent to ₨17 million or US$110,000 in 2019) in tax up to 2019."
The documents released by the FBR also state that during this period he was exempted for some years from paying tax.
"On 3 January 2022, FBR released its 2019 tax directory for parliamentarians and it was revealed that Khan had paid ₨9.8 million (US$61,174)	 in taxes in 2019.After the May 2013 elections, Mohammed Hanif writing for The Guardian termed Khan's support as appealing ""to the educated middle classes but Pakistan's main problem is that there aren't enough educated urban middle-class citizens in the country""."
"Pankaj Mishra writing for The New York Times in 2012, charactised Khan as a ""cogent picture out of his—and Pakistan's—clashing identities"" adding that ""his identification with the suffering masses and his attacks on his affluent, English-speaking peers have long been mocked in the living rooms of Lahore and Karachi as the hypocritical ravings of ""Im the Dim"" and ""Taliban Khan""—the two favored monikers for him."""
"Mishra concluded with ""like all populist politicians, Khan appears to offer something to everyone."
"Yet the great differences between his constituencies—socially liberal, upper-middle-class Pakistanis and the deeply conservative residents of Pakistan's tribal areas—seem irreconcilable."
"""On 18 March 2012, Salman Rushdie criticised Khan for refusing to attend the India Today Conference because of Rushdie's attendance."
"Khan cited the ""immeasurable hurt"" that Rushdie's writings have caused Muslims around the world."
"Rushdie, in turn, suggested that Khan was a ""dictator in waiting."""
"In 2011, While writing for The Washington Post, Richard Leiby termed Khan as an underdog adding that he ""often sounds like a pro-democracy liberal but is well known for his coziness with conservative Islamist parties."""
"Ayesha Siddiqa, in September 2014, writing for The Express Tribune, claimed that ""while we can all sympathise with Khan's right to change the political tone, it would be worthwhile for him to envision how he would, if he did become the prime minister of this country, put the genie back into the bottle."""
"H. M. Naqvi termed Khan as a ""sort of a Ron Paul figure"", adding that ""there is no taint of corruption and there is his anti-establishment message."
"""During the 1970s and 1980s, Khan was a popular sex symbol."
"He became known as a socialite in English high society, and sported a playboy image amongst the British press and paparazzi due to his ""non-stop partying"" at London nightclubs such as Annabel's and Tramp, though he claims to have hated English pubs and never drank alcohol."
"British heiress Sita White, daughter of Gordon White, Baron White of Hull, became the mother of his alleged lovechild daughter, Tyrian Jade White."
"A judge in the US ruled him to be the father of Tyrian due to his failure to appear in court, but Khan has denied paternity and asked for the case to be open in Pakistani courts."
"Later in 2007, Election Commission of Pakistan ruled in favour of Khan and dismissed the ex parte judgment of the US court, on grounds that it was neither admissible in evidence before any court or tribunal in Pakistan nor executable against him."
"About his lifestyle as a bachelor, he has often said that, ""I never claim to have led an angelic life."
"""Declan Walsh in The Guardian newspaper in England in 2005 described Khan as a ""miserable politician,"" observing that, ""Khan's ideas and affiliations since entering politics in 1996 have swerved and skidded like a rickshaw in a rainshower..."
"He preaches democracy one day but gives a vote to reactionary mullahs the next."""
"Khan has also been accused by some opponents and critics of hypocrisy and opportunism, including what has been called his life's ""playboy to puritan U-turn."""
"Political commentator Najam Sethi, stated that, ""A lot of the Imran Khan story is about backtracking on a lot of things he said earlier, which is why this doesn't inspire people."""
"Author Fatima Bhutto has criticised Khan for ""incredible coziness not with the military but with dictatorship"" as well as some of his political decisions."
"Nevertheless, Khan's approval rating since he became Prime Minister remained comparatively robust for an officeholder in Pakistani politics with a majority approving (51%), compared to 46% disapproval and 3% undecided."
"Other polls suggested his approval was as high as 57%.During his cricketing days, Khan featured in many advertisements and television commercials as a celebrity brand endorser."
"These included Pepsi Pakistan, Brooke Bond, Thums Up (along with Sunil Gavaskar), and the Indian soap brand Cinthol, at a time when Bollywood legend Vinod Khanna was also endorsing the same product."
"His popularity in India was such that it was ""unmatched in an era when there were no smartphones to take selfies."
"He was mobbed everywhere he went."""
"The late veteran Bollywood actor Dev Anand even offered him a role in his sports action-thriller movie Awwal Number (1990), that of a cricket star in decline opposite an upcoming cricketer essayed by Aamir Khan, and as he refused, citing his lack of acting skills, the role eventually went to Aditya Pancholi."
"In 2010, a Pakistani production house produced a biographical film based on Khan's life, titled Kaptaan:"
The Making of a Legend.
"The title, which is Urdu for 'Captain', depicts Khan's captaincy and career with the Pakistan cricket team which led them to victory in the 1992 cricket world cup, as well as events which shaped his life; from being ridiculed in cricket to being labelled a playboy; from the death of his mother to his efforts and endeavours in building the first cancer hospital in Pakistan; from being the first Chancellor of the University of Bradford to the building of Namal University."
"Canadian rock band Nickelback released a music video for its politically themed single Edge of a Revolution, featuring a short clip of a Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) rally among other protests."
The brief clip from the PTI rally shows red and green party flags along with a poster of PTI Chairman Imran Khan who was the most popular opposition leader.
"In his virtual address at the 76th Session of the United Nations General Assembly on 24 September 2021, Khan remarked that many Pakistani Pashtuns ""had strong sympathies with the Afghan Taliban, not because of their religious ideology, but because of Pashtun nationalism."""
His comments prompted outrage among many Pashtuns who called on him to apologise.
"Khan made similar comments also on 11 October, which triggered a protest in Peshawar the next day by the leftist Mazdoor Kisan Party (MKP)."
"The Awami National Party (ANP) and the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM) also condemned Khan for ""linking the Pashtuns with terrorists."
"""During his keynote address at the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation's (OIC) Extraordinary Session of Foreign Ministers on 19 December 2021, which was held in Islamabad to discuss the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan, Khan said not allowing girls to study was part of Afghan culture, and that the world should respect that."
"His remarks were criticised by many people from Afghanistan and Pakistan, including former Afghan President Hamid Karzai."
"Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai also slammed Khan's remarks, saying ""I nearly lost my life fighting against the Taliban’s ban on girls’ education."
"""He had numerous relationships during his bachelor life."
He was then known as a hedonistic bachelor and a playboy who was active on the London nightclub circuit.
"Many girlfriends are unknown and were called ""mysterious blondes"" by British newspaper The Times."
"Some of the women he has been associated with include Zeenat Aman, Emma Sergeant, Susie Murray-Philipson, Sita White, Sarah Crawley, Stephanie Beacham, Goldie Hawn, Kristiane Backer, Susannah Constantine, Marie Helvin, Caroline Kellett, Liza Campbell, Anastasia Cooke, Hannah Mary Rothschild, and Lulu Blacker."
"His first girlfriend, Emma Sergeant, an artist and the daughter of British investor Sir Patrick Sergeant, introduced him to socialites."
They first met in 1982 and subsequently visited Pakistan.
She accompanied him on various Pakistani cricket team tours including in Peshawar and Australian tour.
"After long separations, his relationship with Sergeant was broken in 1986."
He then had a short relationship with Susie Murray-Philipson whom he invited to Pakistan and had dinner with in 1982.
She also made various artistic portraits of Khan during their relationship.
"In a book published in 2009, Christopher Sandford claimed that former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and Imran Khan had a close relationship when both were students in Oxford."
He wrote that Bhutto at the age of 21 first became close to Khan in 1975.
They remained in a relationship for about two months.
His mother also tried to have an arranged marriage between them.
"He further claimed that they had a ""romantic relationship"", which was refuted by Khan who said they were only friends."
"Khan had a notable relationship with the heiress Sita White, daughter of the British industrialist Gordon White."
They remained in the relationship for about six years having met in 1987–88.
"White claimed that Khan agreed to have a child with her in 1991; her daughter, Tyrian Jade, was born in June 1992 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles."
"White claimed that Khan subsequently refused to accept Tyrian as his child because she was a girl, and had urged White to have an abortion."
Tyrian was noted for her resemblance to Khan.
A court in Los Angeles ruled that Khan was the girl's father in 1997.
"In 2004, after Sita White's death, Khan agreed to accept Tyrian as his child and welcomed her into his family."
"Khan's former wife, Reham Khan, alleged in her book that he had told her that he had four other children out of wedlock in addition to Tyrian White."
"Allegedly, some of his children had Indian mothers and the eldest was aged 34 in 2018."
"Reham subsequently conceded that she did not know the identities of Khan's children or the veracity of his statements and that ""you can never make out whether he tells the truth."""
"Reham's book was published on 12 July 2018, 13 days before the 2018 Pakistani general election, leading to claims that its publication was intended to damage Imran Khan's electoral prospects."
"On 16 May 1995, at the age of 43, Khan married 21-year-old Jemima Goldsmith, in a two-minute ceremony conducted in Urdu in Paris."
"A month later, on 21 June, they were married again in a civil ceremony at the Richmond registry office in England."
Jemima converted to Islam.
"The couple have two sons, Sulaiman Isa and Kasim."
